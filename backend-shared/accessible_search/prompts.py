Instructions: Below is a list of OPTIONS, each of which is the heading of a page with information.
A user has asked the above query and thinks the answer can be obtained using one of the pages in the OPTIONS.
Select a single value from the OPTIONS, which are separated by '{OPTION_SEPARATOR}'. Select the option which seems most relevant to answering the query.
Before selecting, translate the query into English if it is not already.
If none of the OPTIONS are obviously relevant to the query, or if the query is not a clearly worded question, select CURRENT PAGE.
If the query relates to this page, the correct page will be the CURRENT PAGE. The content of this page is given as the context below, if it is available.
Your RESPONSE should only contain a single value from OPTIONS with no further explanation or discussion.
